<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The examples in this folder illustrate how to handle service errors in the webMethods
Integration Server.  There are two approaches to handling errors in this folder that both
accomplish the exact same task.

Approach one, sample.errorHandling:approach1, uses a Java wrapper service to invoke a
service that could fail inside of a try/catch block.  If any error is thrown while
processing the service that could fail such as a null pointer, divide by zero, etc,
then it is caught in the catch block.

Approach two, sample.errorHandling:approach2, uses a series of SEQUENCE statements
to simulate a Java try/catch block.  If any error is thrown while
processing the service that could fail such as a null pointer, divide by zero, etc,
then it is caught in the SEQUENCE emulating a catch block.

Which approach to use is up to you, the developer.  Keep in mind that if you use approach one,
you will not be able to step into the flow services that are invoked by the Java wrapper.</P>

<H2>Setup Requirements</H2>
<P>There are two services that can be executed to show you the error handling examples.  The services
are sample.errorHandling:approach1 and sample.errorHandling:approach2.  Hit F7 to begin stepping
through the service.  When prompted for input, set the status equal to either "true" or "false".
Detailed explanations of these services can be found in the Input/Output tab of each service. </P>
