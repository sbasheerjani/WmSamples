<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The examples illustrate the use of webMethods' dynamic server pages (DSP).  A DSP
is a document embedded with special codes (tags) that instruct the webMethods Integration
Server to perform certain actions when an HTTP (or HTTPS) client requests the document.
DSPs are used to construct browser-based applications.</P>

<P>Our example is a browser based application for viewing Sales Orders that are located
in a specific directory on the file system.  Let's imagine these are Sales Orders that
have just been created today.</P>

<P>For more information on DSPs, refer to the ISTemplatesAndDSPs.pdf file located in the
{ServerHome}\doc directory.</P>

<H2>Setup Instructions</H2>
<P>1.  Open the /WmSamples/Orders/Orders.dsp and OrderDetails.dsp file in a text editor.
Review and understand all of the code contained in these files.  You will notice the files
invoke services on the webMethods Server. The code is documented for your understanding</P>
<P>2.  Open the Developer and understand what each of the services invoked is doing.</P>
<P>3.  Go to:  http://{Server Home}:port/WmSamples/Orders/Orders.dsp</P>
<P>4.  Enter your username and password.  According to the /WmSamples/Orders/.access file, you
must be a member of the "Developer" group to run this service.</P>
<P>5.  View the results</P>
<P>6.  Click on one of the order numbers.  This will invoke the OrderDetails.dsp file.</P>
<P>7.  View the results</P>
