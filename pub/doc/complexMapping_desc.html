<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The examples in this folder illustrate how to develop and implement a complex mapping.  The
example in this folder has a company (XYZ corp.) that receives a cXML Order Request from one of its
suppliers and needs to map it into their internal Purchase Order format for processing.  This is a
common scenario for organizations.  They will map cXML, OBI, xCBL, etc into their internal
standard in order to build a layer of abstraction.  Once in their internal format, they will
send it to the appropriate backend system for processing.</P>

<H2>Setup Requirements</H2>
<P>To execute the complex mapping example in this folder, you just need to run the
sample.complexMapping.test:runComplexMapping service.  It sets the input cXML string, converts
it to a node, and then invokes the sample.complexMapping.messageBuilder:buildPurchaseOrder
service.  Detailed explanations of these services can be found in the Input/Output tab
of each service. </P>
